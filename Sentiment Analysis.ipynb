As a placeholder, as we think about what you said, trying to arrest the \\\\ngrowth of CET1, for now, should we just assume that anything that you don't need for organic growth and your dividend obligations in terms of \\\\nthat 15.7% will be bought back by the company as we think about? I know you don't want to predict the buyback, but is that sort of just a \\\\nplaceholder for now as we think about what can return back to shareholders in the form of repurchase? \\\\nGiven Answer: Yeah. You've quoted our capital hierarchy, and your conclusion flows naturally from my statement that we do want to arrest the growth of the \\\\nexcess. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSo, we are never going to tell the market what we're going to do. You all know that everybody is out there modeling these things, trading \\\\nagainst these things. So, steady consistent buyers in the marketplace who are so predictable are making a mistake. \\\\n... \\\\nOperator: Does that conclude your question, Erika? \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVery good. We can go to the next question. Thanks. Yeah. \\\\n... \\\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. \\\\n\\\\nReference Info: On to balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.7%, up 40 basis points versus the prior quarter, as net \\\\nincome and lower RWA were largely offset by both OCI losses and capital distributions, which included $4 billion of net common share \\\\nrepurchases this quarter. The $24 billion decrease in RWA reflects a seasonal decline in Markets activity and lower wholesale lending, which\\\\nremind you that there were a number of significant items in 2024. Excluding those items, the Firm reported net income of $54 billion, EPS of \\\\n$18.22, revenue of $173 billion, and we delivered an ROTCE of 20%. Touching on a couple of highlights for the year. In CCB, we had a record \\\\nnumber of first-time investors and acquired nearly 10 million new card accounts. In CIB, we had record revenue in Markets, Payments and\\\\nFinally, I want to point out that starting this quarter, we are including an estimate of earnings-at-risk in the earnings supplement so you no \\\\nlonger have to wait for the K or the Q to get that number. Now, let's turn to expenses on page 10. We expect 2025 (sic) [adjusted] expense to be \\\\nabout $95 billion. Looking at the chart in the middle of the page, I'll touch on the drivers of the year-on-year change, which you'll note are very\\\\nbillion, with an ROTCE of 21%. On page 2, we have more on our fourth-quarter results. The Firm reported revenue of $43.7 billion, up $3.8 billion \\\\nor 10% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was down $548 million or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and the associated deposit margin \\\\ncompression, as well as lower deposit balances in CCB, largely offset by the impact of securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in\\\\n\\\\nClassify the answer as:\\\\nWell-answered\\\\nPartially-answered\\\\nDodged\\\\n\\\\nAlso, provide an explanation.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: Partially-answered\\\\n\\\\nExplanation: The question asked about the assumption that the excess CET1 not needed for organic growth and dividend obligations will be used for share buybacks. The answer does acknowledge the question and refers to the capital hierarchy, but it does not directly address the specific question about share buybacks. Instead, it focuses on the firm's general strategy of not predicting its actions in the market and the risks of being too predictable. The answer does not provide a clear answer to the question about share buybacks.\\\"}]\",\n          \"[{'generated_text': \\\"\\\\nYou are an expert at analyzing earnings call Q&A sessions.

As a placeholder, as we think about what you said, trying to arrest the \\\\ngrowth of CET1, for now, should we just assume that anything that you don't need for organic growth and your dividend obligations in terms of \\\\nthat 15.7% will be bought back by the company as we think about? I know you don't want to predict the buyback, but is that sort of just a \\\\nplaceholder for now as we think about what can return back to shareholders in the form of repurchase? \\\\nGiven Answer: Yeah. You've quoted our capital hierarchy, and your conclusion flows naturally from my statement that we do want to arrest the growth of the \\\\nexcess. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSo, we are never going to tell the market what we're going to do. You all know that everybody is out there modeling these things, trading \\\\nagainst these things. So, steady consistent buyers in the marketplace who are so predictable are making a mistake. \\\\n... \\\\nOperator: Does that conclude your question, Erika? \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVery good. We can go to the next question. Thanks. Yeah. \\\\n... \\\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. \\\\n\\\\nReference Info: On to balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.7%, up 40 basis points versus the prior quarter, as net \\\\nincome and lower RWA were largely offset by both OCI losses and capital distributions, which included $4 billion of net common share \\\\nrepurchases this quarter. The $24 billion decrease in RWA reflects a seasonal decline in Markets activity and lower wholesale lending, which\\\\nremind you that there were a number of significant items in 2024. Excluding those items, the Firm reported net income of $54 billion, EPS of \\\\n$18.22, revenue of $173 billion, and we delivered an ROTCE of 20%. Touching on a couple of highlights for the year. In CCB, we had a record \\\\nnumber of first-time investors and acquired nearly 10 million new card accounts. In CIB, we had record revenue in Markets, Payments and\\\\nFinally, I want to point out that starting this quarter, we are including an estimate of earnings-at-risk in the earnings supplement so you no \\\\nlonger have to wait for the K or the Q to get that number. Now, let's turn to expenses on page 10. We expect 2025 (sic) [adjusted] expense to be \\\\nabout $95 billion. Looking at the chart in the middle of the page, I'll touch on the drivers of the year-on-year change, which you'll note are very\\\\nbillion, with an ROTCE of 21%. On page 2, we have more on our fourth-quarter results. The Firm reported revenue of $43.7 billion, up $3.8 billion \\\\nor 10% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was down $548 million or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and the associated deposit margin \\\\ncompression, as well as lower deposit balances in CCB, largely offset by the impact of securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in\\\\n\\\\nClassify the answer as:\\\\nWell-answered\\\\nPartially-answered\\\\nDodged\\\\n\\\\nAlso, provide an explanation.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: Partially-answered\\\\n\\\\nExplanation: The question asked about the assumption that the excess CET1 not needed for organic growth and dividend obligations will be used for share buybacks. The answer does acknowledge the question and refers to the capital hierarchy, but it does not directly address the specific question about share buybacks. Instead, it focuses on the firm's general strategy of not predicting its actions in the market and the risks of being too predictable. The answer does not provide a clear answer to the question about share buybacks.\\\"}]\",\n          \"[{'generated_text': \\\"\\\\nYou are an expert at analyzing earnings call Q&A sessions.
