I mean, the world is generally your oyster, right?

Good morning, Jeremy. \\n \\nGiven Answer: Good morning, Steve. \\n \\nReference Info: MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION \\n ...  \\n\\nOperator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This call is being \\nrecorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. The presentation is available on \\nJPMorgan Chase's website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please standby.\\nAt this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. \\n ...  \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. \\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $18.1 billion, EPS of $6.12 on revenue of $51 \\nbillion, with an ROTCE of 28%. These results included the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares and the $1 billion Foundation\\nTo finish up, we have the outlook on page 8. Our 2024 guidance including the drivers remains unchanged from what we said at Investor Day. \\nWe continue to expect NII and NII ex. Markets of approximately $91 billion, adjusted expense of about $92 billion, and on credit, Card net \\ncharge-off rate of approximately 3.4%.\\nThen, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 6. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.3 billion, with pre-tax \\nmargin of 32%. Revenue of $5.3 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and \\nstrong net inflows, as well as higher brokerage activity, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.5 billion were up 12%\\n\\nClassify the answer as:\\nWell-answered\\nPartially-answered\\nDodged\\n\\nAlso, provide an explanation.\\n\\nAnswer: Partially-answered\\n\\nExplanation: The question was not directly addressed in the given answer. The answer simply greeted the questioner, while the question was asking for financial information about JPMorgan Chase. The answer did provide some specific information about the company's net income, EPS, revenue, and ROTCE, but it did not address the questioner's specific request for information about the company's outlook on page 8. Therefore, the answer is classified as Partially-answered.\"}]\n","\n","  --> so far: 01 min :09 s  --> this cell: 00 min :0.005 s"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def clean_answers(ans):\n","

Maybe just one quick follow-up in terms of your just \\\\noverall posturing. You were patient and smart when rates were low, waited to deploy, worked out great, we know that story. Now, it seems like \\\\nyou have tons of excess liquidity and you're being patient and rates are high, and I'm curious on how you think about what kind of triggers, \\\\nwhat kind of things you're looking for in the market to know if and when you would extend duration. \\\\nGiven Answer: Right. I mean, on duration, in truth, we have actually added a little bit of duration over the last couple of quarters. So, that's one thing to say. \\\\nThat was more last quarter than this quarter. But, I guess, I would just caution you from a little bit away from looking at kind of our reported \\\\ncash balances and our balance sheet and concluding that, when you look at the duration concept holistically, that there is a lot to be done \\\\ndifferently on the duration front. So, clearly, it's true that empirically we behaved, like very asset-sensitively in this rate hiking cycle and that \\\\nhas resulted in a lot of excess NII generation sort of on the way up in the near term. \\\\nReference Info: In terms of the outlook, we're pleased with both the year-on-year and sequential improvement in the quarter. We remain cautiously optimistic \\\\nabout the pipeline, although many of the same headwinds are still in effect. It's also worth noting that pull-forward refinancing activity was a \\\\nmeaningful contributor to the strong performance in the first half of the year.\\\\nIn Banking & Payments, average loans were up 2% year-on-year due to the impact of the First Republic acquisition and flat sequentially. \\\\nDemand for new loans remains muted as middle market and large corporate clients remain somewhat cautious due to the economic \\\\nenvironment, and revolver utilization continues to be below pre-pandemic levels.

In Advisory, fees were up 45%, primarily driven \\\\nby the closing of a few large deals and a weak prior-year quarter. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully, with Equity up 56% and Debt up \\\\n51%, benefiting from favorable market conditions.\\\\nPayments revenue was $4.5 billion, down 4% year-on-year, as deposit margin compression and higher deposit-related client credits were \\\\nlargely offset by fee growth.

Thank you for all that, Jeremy. And just one on the Consumer side, just anything you\\'re noticing in terms of people just have been \\\\nwaiting for this delinquency stabilization on the Credit Card side. Obviously, your loss rates are coming in as you expected, and we did see 30 \\\\ndays pretty flat and 90 days come down a little bit. Is that seasonal? Is it just a good rate of change trend? Any thoughts there? Thanks. \\\\nGiven Answer: Yeah. I still feel like when it comes to Card charge-offs and delinquencies, there\\'s just not much to see there. It\\'s still – it\\'s normalization, not \\\\ndeterioration. It\\'s in line with expectations. As I say, we always look quite closely inside the cohort, inside the income cohorts. And when you \\\\nlook in there, specifically, for example, on spend patterns, you can see a little bit of evidence of behavior that\\'s consistent with a little bit of \\\\nweakness in the lower income segments where you see a little bit of rotation on the spend out of discretionary into non-discretionary. \\\\n\\\\nThanks, Ken. \\\\n... \\\\nReference Info: In terms of the outlook, we\\'re pleased with both the year-on-year and sequential improvement in the quarter.

As you evaluate just different capital \\nscenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the Firm versus the 17% target? And \\nif so, just how that might impact or inform your appetite for buybacks going forward? \\n    \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Okay, got it. That's helpful. Just following up on capital returns on Steve's question, I think you highlighted in response it's a matter of when, \\nnot if, and obviously, Jamie’s not there, you can’t speak for Jamie, but seems to have shown limited enthusiasm for a special dividend or \\nbuybacks at current valuations. Can you just give us a sense of how you’re thinking about the various options? Any updated thoughts on a \\nspecial dividend? And can you do other things like, for example, have a material increase in your dividend payout, sort of a step function \\nincrease, where keep that flat and grow into that, grow your earnings into that over time? Can you just maybe give us a sense of how you're \\nthinking about what options you have available to deploy that capital?    \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Okay, great.

Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy, great to see the progress on Investment Banking fees up sequentially and 50% year-over-year, \\nand I saw you on the tape earlier just talking about still regulatory concerns a little bit in the advisory space and we clearly didn't see the debt \\npull-forward play through because your DCM was great again. I'm just wondering just where you feel the environment is relative to the \\npotential and just where the dialogue is across the three main bucket areas in terms of, like how does this feel in terms of a current \\nenvironment versus a potential environment that we could still see ahead. Thanks.    \n","7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 you see the same trend happening on the asset-backed finance side because that's a bigger part of the world and it's a bigger part of your \\nbusiness?

And as a follow-up, you've been very clear about the Consumer Credit Card charge-offs and delinquency levels, and we all know \\nabout the Commercial Real Estate Office. And you always talk about overearning on net interest income, of course. One of the great credit \\nquality stories for everyone, including yourselves, is the C&I portfolio, how strong it's been in this elevated rate environment? And I know your \\nnumbers are still quite low, but in the Corporate and Investment Bank, you had about a $500 million pickup in non-accrual loans. Can you \\nshare with us what are you seeing in C&I? Are there any early signs of cracks or anything?

I just had one clean-up question, Jeremy. The consensus provision for 2024 is $10.7 billion. Could you maybe clarify for \\nonce and for all sort of Jamie's comments at an industry conference earlier and try to sort of triangulate if that $10.7 billion provision is \\nappropriate for the growth level that you are planning for in Card?    \n","25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Right.

I think year-over-year in 2025, consensus has it down 4% from your \\nnew level. So it sounds like consensus still has room to come down, and based on the forward curve, Jeremy, it could be a little bit worse \\nyear-over-year than the fourth quarter sequential rate. But that being said, as Jamie noted, we have no idea what the curve is going to look \\nlike. Right? It's gyrated so much. And so as we think about the curve, is it better for JPMorgan to have more cuts in the short end but \\nsteepness or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve?    \n","32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And if I can ask my second question, and, Jamie, I completely understand your frustration. And to be fair, your long-term shareholders really \\ndon't care about whether it's $87 billion or $85 billion. Right? They care about your return on equity. To that end, I mean, it's insane how much \\ncapital you generate each quarter, 72 basis points this quarter. \\n\\nAnd so, beyond the standard boilerplate questions you're going to get on buyback and organic growth, yada, yada, dividend increases, how \\nshould we think about JPMorgan deploying this capital?

Jeremy, when you guys look at your current capital ratios, they are obviously very healthy. \\nCan you guys give us some color on the new Basel III? We don't know what the specifics are, but as Vice Chair Barr touched on some of the \\nspecifics, it looks like capital requirements for yourself and your peers will come down a fair amount from the original proposal. \\n\\nHow are you guys thinking about that? Do you have any insights on how much it may fall from the original proposal to where you are today?    \n","39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            So if you were asked by the next administration to serve the country, would you be open to considering it?    \n","43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Oh, hi.

Right? I should embed that outlook. Is that right? And that's embedded in how you're thinking about it. I know we don't \\nhave a number for you for NII for 2025 but it is in there.

Then one for Jamie. Jamie, we did talk already quite a bit about the capital that you have, capital in store. Just wanted to understand \\nhow you're thinking about that opportunity set that's in front of you with regard to using it for potentially portfolio acquisitions. I realize that \\ndepositories are not on the docket, but we all know there's portfolios out there that might be looking for a home. And could you give us a sense \\nas to how interested you might be in acquiring assets at this stage?    \n","50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         And what about like a private label credit card, for example.    \n","51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I'm just wondering about private label credit card for example.

Simple and then more difficult, I guess. Jamie, who's your successor? And then the second question is, I know I asked the question at \\nInvestor Day, why not stay as CEO a little bit longer? I think what I'm hearing from investors now, it goes up and down, but I think investors \\nwould like you to stay. So, why say you're going to stay less than five years? You're finally getting what you wanted, 15 years, your spaghetti \\nchart about the regulatory structure and the unpredictability of capital requirements and regulatory costs, and it seems like you're finally \\ngetting what you've been playing for. So, why not stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do so? And what would you do otherwise \\nanyway? You don't play golf. You aren't going to be Treasury Secretary. Seems like your work is your hobby, right? So how much longer would \\nyou stay around?    \n","58                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Who's your successor?    \n","60                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Hey. Good morning. Maybe just on regulation, we have a new administration coming in. We have a new, soon-to-be, I guess, a new head of \\nregulation at the Fed. So, maybe just talk about, again, what areas of the regulatory structure, if it were to change, would be most impactful for \\nyou. And is there any areas where you think capital requirements could actually go down? Or is this more of a story of requirements just simply \\nstop going up? Thanks.    \n","62                                           Yes. Hi, good morning. Wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of, Jeremy, the crosscurrents in terms of \\nthe denominator. So, if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put \\nyou in a range of a 5% G-SIB. So, obviously, from what we understand, if you print that – somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then \\nyour G-SIB surcharge goes up by – to 5% or by 50 basis points two years and one day from now. At the same time, around the holidays, we did \\nget the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit from the banks. In terms of the transparency, it looks like the transparency \\nis going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year's stress test. \\n\\nSo, as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7% is clearly a huge number. So, as we think about your \\nreturns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift. So, how should we think about those crosscurrents in terms of two big \\ncomponents, clearly, one is your G-SIB surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer?    \n","63                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And just a follow-up question – a follow-up to John's line of questioning. As a placeholder, as we think about what you said, trying to arrest the \\ngrowth of CET1, for now, should we just assume that anything that you don't need for organic growth and your dividend obligations in terms of \\nthat 15.7% will be bought back by the company as we think about? I know you don't want to predict the buyback, but is that sort of just a \\nplaceholder for now as we think about what can return back to shareholders in the form of repurchase?    \n","66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Hi. Good morning.    \n","67  Guys, can you hear me okay? All right. Just want to make sure you can hear me. So this has been a great call. First, congratulations on a great \\nquarter. It's been a great call with a lot of robust questions here. You're like, what else is there to ask? Here's my question. As we think about the \\nNII outlook and you highlighted the NIM pressure, but loan – but basically, balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to – \\ncould you help me understand the order of the drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth \\ninflecting? Is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think \\nabout your comments around you've got the green market share number one, you've got the yellow, you've got the red, places maybe we can't \\nsee. Could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are – where they are? Are they just scattered, everybody – every single \\nbusiness has one? Or are there some that have more than others and, therefore, more opportunities? And is it more balance sheet or fee-\\ngenerative? That's kind of what I'd like to just discuss if you have a minute. Thanks.    \n","70                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Hi, Jeremy.

                                   Right. Okay. Thanks, Steve. And actually, before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not able to join because \\nhe has a travel conflict overseas, so it's just going to be me today. \\n\\nOkay. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So, let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that question would be \\nno. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on ROTCE. \\nIf you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that before the Basel III Endgame proposal, we had a 17% through the \\ncycle target, and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator. \\nAnd while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those would be thought of as \\nmitigants rather than things that would actually, like increase the ROTCE. And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed. \\n\\nSo, as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is, yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage \\nyou've been reading and it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here. But in reality, we don't know anything you \\ndon't know. We don't know how reliable the press coverage is. And so, in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital return and buyback \\ntrajectory, not much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comments that I made then, the comments that Jamie \\nmade then, as well as the comments that Jamie made the subsequent week at an industry conference. \\n\\nSo, maybe I'll just briefly summarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is, one, we do recognize that our current practice on \\ncapital return and buybacks does lead to an ever-expanding CET1 ratio. But obviously, we're going to run the company over the cycle over \\ntime at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirement. So, after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of \\nthe deployment of the capital, one way or another, is a matter of when, not if. \\n\\nOn the capital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly. Growing the business \\norganically and inorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the board's announced intention to increase it to \\n$1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year. So, that's a testament to our performance and that is a return of capital.    \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sure. Yeah. I mean, I would direct you to read, I'm sure you have, Jamie's comments at the industry conference, where he participated the \\nweek after Investor Day because he went into just good amount of detail on this stuff, addressing some of these points. And I think this \\ncomment there about the special dividend was that it's not really our preference. We hear from people that many of our investors wouldn't find \\nthat particularly appealing, and he said as much that it wouldn't be sort of our first choice.    \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Thanks, Saul. \\n...    \n","5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Yeah. Thanks, Ken. It's progress, right? I mean, we're happy to see the progress. People have been talking about depressed banking fee \\nwallet for some time and it's nice to see not only the year-on-year pop from a low base, but also a nice sequential improvement. So, that's the \\nfirst thing to say. \\n\\nIn terms of dialog and engagement, it's definitely elevated. So, the dialog on ECM is elevated, and the dialog on M&A is quite robust as well. \\nSo, all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this space. But there \\nare some important caveats. So, on the DCM side, yeah, we made pull-forward comments in the first quarter, but we still feel that this second \\nquarter still reflects a bunch of pull-forward and therefore, we're reasonably cautious about the second half of the year. Importantly, a lot of the \\nactivity is refinancing activity as opposed to, for example, acquisition finance. So, the fact that M&A remains still relatively muted in terms of  \\n\\n7 \\n\\nactual deals has knock-on effects on DCM as well. And when a higher percentage of the wallet is refied, then the pull-forward risk becomes a \\nlittle bit higher. \\n\\nOn ECM, if you look at it kind of at a remove, you might ask the question, given the performance of the overall indices, you would think it \\nwould be a really booming environment for IPOs for example. And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would otherwise expect, \\nand that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that, as has been widely discussed, the extent to which the performance of the large \\nindices is driven by, like a few stocks, the sort of mid-cap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had \\nmuch more muted performance.    \n","7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, on private credit, so nothing really new to say there. I think, I guess, one way the environment's evolving a little bit \\nis, as you know, a lot of money has been raised in private credit funds looking for deals. And sort of a little bit to my prior comment, in a \\nrelatively muted acquisition finance environment, at this point you've got a lot of money chasing, like not that many deals. So, the space is a \\nlittle bit quieter than it was at the margin. \\n\\nAnother interesting thing to note is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated leveraged \\nfinance market making their way into the private market as well as sort of people realize that even in the private market you probably need \\nsome of those protections in some cases, which is sort of supportive of the theme that we've been talking about, about convergence between \\nthe direct lending space and the syndicated lending space, which is kind of our core thesis here, which is that we can offer best-in-class \\nservice across the entire continuum, including secondary market trading and so on. So, we feel optimistic about our offering there. I think the \\ncurrent environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was. So, it's maybe not a great moment to, like kind of test whether we're doing a lot \\nmore or less in the space, so to speak.    \n","9

reasonable buffer, which, depending on the shape of rules, could be a little bit \\nsmaller or a little bit bigger and no small part is a function of the volatility of those rules, which goes back to my prior comments on SCB and \\nCCAR. But obviously, as you well know, what actually matters is less the ratio and more the dollars and at this point, the dollars are very much \\na function of where rules land and where the RWA lands and obviously, things like GSIB recalibration and so on. So, we've done a bunch of \\nscenario analysis along the lines of what I did at Investor Day that informs those numbers. But that is obviously one big element of uncertainty \\nbehind that 17%, which is why at Investor Day when we talked about it, both Daniel and I were quite specific about saying that we thought \\n17% was still achievable, assuming a reasonable outcome on the Basel III Endgame. \\n   \n","16

It's a good question. I think the short answer is no. We're not really seeing early signs of cracks in C&I. I mean, yes, I agree with you, \\nlike the C&I charge-off rate has been very, very low for a long time. I think we emphasized that at last year's Investor Day, if I remember \\ncorrectly. I think the C&I charge-off rate we've seen in 10 years was something like literally zero. So, that is clearly very low by historical \\nstandards. And while we take a lot of pride in that number and I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of \\nour credit culture across the bankers and the risk team, that's not – we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation. So, you \\nhave to assume there will be some upward pressure on that. But in any given quarter, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite \\nidiosyncratic. So, I don't think that anything in the current quarter's results is indicative of anything broader, and I haven't heard anyone \\ninternally talk that way, I would say. \\n   \n","22

   Yeah. Happy to clarify that. So, Jamie's comments were that the allowance – the build and the Card allowance, so we're talking about Card \\nspecifically, we expected something like $2 billion for the full year. As I sit here today, our expectation for that number is actually slightly  \\nhigher, but it's in the ballpark. And I think in terms of what that means for the consensus on the overall allowance change for the year, last time \\nI checked, it still looked a little low on that front. So, who knows what it'll actually wind up being, but that remains our view. \\n\\nOne question that we've gotten is how to reconcile that build to the 12% growth in OS that we've talked about because it seems like a little bit \\nhigh relative to what you would have otherwise assumed if you apply some sort of a standard coverage ratio to that growth. But the reason  \\n\\n14 \\n\\nthat's the case is essentially a combination of higher revolving mix, as we continue to see some normalization revolve in that 12%, as well as \\nseasoning of earlier vintages, which comes with slightly higher allowance per unit of OS growth. \\n\\n\\nThanks, Erika. \\n...    \n","25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Thanks, Jim. \\n... \\n\\nOperator: We have no further questions. \\n... \\nJeremy Barnum \\nChief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. \\n\\nVery good.

Okay. You threw a curve ball at the end there, Erika. I wasn't expecting that to be the end of your question. But let me answer the \\nbeginning of your question, and then I'll also answer the end of your question. \\n\\nSo we see the current 2025 consensus for NII ex. Markets to be currently at $87 billion, which is obviously lower than it was at the conference \\nearlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a little toppy, but it's definitely in the \\nballpark. \\n\\nNow that consists of, I already mentioned previously that we sort of expect the NII trough sometime in the middle of the year, so you can kind \\nof assemble the parts. You've got a fourth quarter run rate, you've got some sequential declines, you've got a trough in the middle of the year, \\nand you've got a rough ballpark for the full year. \\n\\nSo you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolve resumes in the \\nback half of the year in both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of Card revolve, although that tailwind will be a little bit less than you \\nmight have otherwise thought. I mean, sorry. A little bit less than it was this year but still a tailwind. \\n\\nCan I just say something. First of all, next time let's just give them the damn number. I don't want to spend all the time on these calls like going \\nthrough what they're guessing what NII is going to be next year. \\n\\nGood. Okay. Now to your question about the EaR. So, a few things to say in there. So, as I already mentioned, when that comes out, it'll show \\na number around $2.1 billion. A very important thing to say is, as you know, the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical EaR \\nis meaningfully higher than our modeled EaR, which is what we disclose. And the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas have, in \\nactuality, been lower than the modeled deposit betas. \\n\\nSo as a starting point, you have to kind of adjust that EaR number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons, \\nactually, there's some nuances around how the dollar, non-dollar sensitivity interact. And then there's your question which is a little bit about \\nthe front-end versus the back-end. \\n\\nSo, what you see is that actually the front-end EaR has gotten smaller and most of the EaR is now in the back-end. So, it's definitely the case \\nthat, all else being equal, a steeper curve is better for us. But I think what I would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical \\nadjustment is disproportionately in the front-end. So therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes, we want a steeper curve, but \\nhaving the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin, for the context of next year's numbers a headwind – \\nwould be a headwind for us, we remain asset sensitive to Fed cuts.  \\n\\n8    \n","32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Okay. First of all, when you say dominant, I'd be very careful on that. We've got some very tough competition, different in different countries, \\ndifferent around the world, fintech companies, direct lenders and I want to give you a very specific comment on direct lending and stuff like \\nthat. So our goal is always to serve our clients. And when I talk about some of these expenses, that is a deployment of capital, and it's a \\ndeployment in a different way. If you open branches, you initially experience an expense, but down the road you need capital to support the \\ndeposits. Same for the Innovation Economy, same for private bankers, et cetera. If you look at it roughly, we have about a minimum $30 billion \\nof excess capital. And for me, it's not burning a hole in my pocket. I look at it as you own the whole company and you can't properly deploy it \\nnow, it is perfectly reasonable to wait. And I've been quite clear that I think the future could be quite turbulent. And asset prices, in my view, in \\nlife you've got to take a view sometimes, are inflated. I don't know if they're extremely inflated or a little bit, but I prefer to wait. \\n\\nWe will be able to deploy it. Our shareholders will be very well served by us waiting. And same thing with deploying capital. We can go buy \\n$100 billion, 6% mortgages, increase our net income by a couple billion tomorrow. We don't make decisions like that. The most important thing \\nwe do is serve our clients well, build the technology and do things like that. And we also don’t know what the real excess capital is yet. So, \\nwe're a little patient. We're going to be a little patient and wait, and it'll be fine. \\n\\nOne last thing. Cash is a very valuable asset sometimes in a turbulent world. And you see my friend Warren Buffett stockpiling cash right now. \\nI mean, people should be a little more thoughtful about how we're trying to navigate in this world and grow for the long term for our company.  \\n...    \n","34                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Yeah. When I said we're at $30 billion of excess, that is assuming Barr's speech, that the 20% goes to 12% or whatever it is, more. It'll be \\nmore than that because there are other factors involved. Now, I was just giving the minimum of excess capital. In my view, it would be more, \\nbut it is what it is and we'll wait to see the final numbers. \\n\\n\\nBut, Gerard, just maybe to give you a bit of color. So, yeah. Obviously, everyone paid a lot of attention to that speech. It was an important \\nspeech. But in the end, we actually just really need to see the proposal because the details matter a lot for this stuff. And so our focus is on \\nhoping to see the proposal so that we can process the detail and continue advocating as appropriate. \\nI note that you talk about requirements coming down relative to what was originally proposed which was obviously true per the speech, but I \\ndo think we need to be a little bit careful not to fall into the trap of saying that that's like progress just because the original proposal was so \\ndramatically higher than what anyone thought was reasonable. And I would remind you, which you obviously know, that before this proposal \\ncame out, it was our position strongly felt, that our then-prevailing capital requirements were, if anything, already more than we needed. \\nSo we've got a long way to go here, and I think our position, which Jamie has been articulating very consistently, is that they need to get it \\nright with the right amount of work, and importantly, do it holistically so it's not just RWA. It's RWA, it's G-SIB, it's SCB, it's CCAR. So that's \\nreally what we feel strongly about. \\n\\n\\nWe just want the numbers to be done right and justified. If they had to go up, we would be fine with that too. We just think they should be done \\nwith real diligence and real thought and a little bit of thought about cost benefit, what it does to the economy, where it pushes lending and \\nthings like that. So we're anxiously awaiting to see the actual detail, because that's what's going to make all the difference. \\n   \n","39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I think the chance of that is almost nil and I probably am not going to do it, but I've always reserved the right.

In other words, it goes back to my prior point and to the point that I had in the prepared remarks about the consumer deposit balances \\nin particular – \\n\\n\\n– that there's lots of different offsetting factors right now, right.

And answering the second question first, look, we're on a path. The path is not just about me, it's about the other senior \\npeople in the company. It's about the Board. If I'm here for several more years, and I may or may not be Chairman. That's going to be up to the \\nBoard. Does it really fit the new CEO and stuff like that? You're talking potentially four, five years or more. I'll be 69 in March. I think it's the \\nrational thing to do. I've had a couple health problems, you know. I just think it makes a lot of sense, and so – and what was your first question \\nagain? \\n   \n","58                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Oh, yeah.

I think it's wonderful that Jenn Piepszak, who does not want to be the CEO, will be here as Chief Operating \\nOfficer and stay after that. So, obviously, she's going to work with those people which I think is great for a company, just having continuity of \\nmanagement and leadership, and will be one of those people. And obviously, we're not going to tell the press, but it's not determined yet.

I mean, it's obviously something we're thinking about a lot. But I could go down some pretty deep rabbit holes speculating on all the \\ndifferent parts of the framework and how they could evolve, and I just don't really think that's productive right now. But let me make some \\nattempt to answer your question. So, backing up a second, if you read Jamie's quotes, they're very consistent with what we've been saying as a \\ncompany for a long time, which is that all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically-assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do  \\ntheir job, supporting the economy, that isn't reflexively anti-bank, that doesn't default to the answer to every question being more of  \\n\\n \\n\\neverything, more capital, more liquidity, that uses data and that balances the obvious goal that we all share of a safe and sound banking system \\nwith actually recognizing that banks play a critical role in supporting growth, and the hope is that we get some of that. \\n\\nCan I just add, no that's great. Jeremy gave it all. Let me add three quick things. Liquidity is also equally important. There's been a lot of \\nrecognition that what counts as liquidity and discount windows and how LCR is done I think is very important. Second is competition. All these \\nthings should be done in light of looking at what kind of public markets you want, what kind of private markets you want, what do you want in \\nthe banking system, what you want out of the banking system. And the third is I think most people realize there is a huge need to take a step \\nback and look at the Byzantine, Balkanized system we built which has negatives, and even the regulators will tell you that. So, at one point, just \\ntake a deep breath. As Jeremy said, let's do the right thing and continue to have the best financial system in the world. \\n   \n","62                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Right, Erika. Okay. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. But let's try and address this not too much great length.  \\nFirst of all, G-SIB. So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter. So, while our  \\ncurrent view of G-SIB number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal  \\nseasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures of various \\ntypes. So that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal patterns. So, not much to see there. \\n\\nAnd the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed G-SIB rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up, with the smaller \\nbuckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it's not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other. But, anyway, for \\nnow, we're managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under 5%. Okay, you mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only \\nthing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking \\nabout for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility, and some of the non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR \\nprocess needs improvement. So, that's great. \\n\\nI think I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me, if you just read what they said publicly in their \\npress releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up. So, let's \\njust hope that we see some significant progress on that front. And then, taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is, what \\nis our core view about, and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator, actually. What is our core \\nview about if you just, for the sake of argument, assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator, like actual need \\nfor capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment.    \n","63                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Yeah.

Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, \\nfrankly, that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance, would be acquisition finance \\nbecause that's been relatively muted as a a function of the M&A environment, and if that picks up you could see more there. Now, those aren't \\nloans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long, so whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever, it's a separate issue. But  \\nas you can see like on our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that Card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a  \\nsignificant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be – it's \\ndecelerating a little bit, rather than the opposite. \\n\\nStill growing above trend obviously, which is great, and it's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're \\ngetting from our Card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well the state of the mortgage market given rates. \\nRates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So, yeah, I think a higher growth \\nenvironment, a little bit more optimism, could you see a bit more loan growth in Business Banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&I at \\nthe margin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So, we'll see. We'll \\nsee what happens there. And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the green, I think you know them, right? And they're aligned with our \\nbig long-standing investment strategies. \\n\\nThank you, Betsy. \\n... \\nOperator: Thank you.

So, of course, there was some \\nexcess, and there was some yield-seeking behavior. So you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives \\nover the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we're in the final innings of that. We're just not seeing nearly as \\nmuch yield-seeking pressure as we had seen. In the meantime, as you well know, we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring all \\nthe new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets.    \n","\n","   evaluation_clean  \n","0            Dodged  \n","1            Dodged  \n","3            Dodged  \n","4            Dodged  \n","5            Dodged  \n","7            Dodged  \n","9            Dodged  \n","12           Dodged  \n","14           Dodged  \n","16           Dodged  \n","18           Dodged  \n","19           Dodged  \n","21           Dodged  \n","22           Dodged  \n","23           Dodged  \n","25           Dodged  \n","30           Dodged  \n","31           Dodged  \n","32           Dodged  \n","34           Dodged  \n","39           Dodged  \n","43           Dodged  \n","44           Dodged  \n","45           Dodged  \n","46           Dodged  \n","48           Dodged  \n","50           Dodged  \n","51           Dodged  \n","54           Dodged  \n","57           Dodged  \n","58           Dodged  \n","60           Dodged  \n","62           Dodged  \n","63           Dodged  \n","66           Dodged  \n","67           Dodged  \n","70           Dodged  \n","71           Dodged  "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-2b37a78c-e87e-4dac-8040-0243e3a1ff51\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>question</th>\n","      <th>answer</th>\n","      <th>evaluation_clean</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Hi.

As you evaluate just different capital \\nscenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the Firm versus the 17% target? And \\nif so, just how that might impact or inform your appetite for buybacks going forward? \\n</td>\n","      <td>Right. Okay. Thanks, Steve. And actually, before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not able to join because \\nhe has a travel conflict overseas, so it's just going to be me today. \\n\\nOkay. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So, let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that question would be \\nno. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on ROTCE. \\nIf you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that before the Basel III Endgame proposal, we had a 17% through the \\ncycle target, and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator. \\nAnd while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those would be thought of as \\nmitigants rather than things that would actually, like increase the ROTCE. And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed. \\n\\nSo, as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is, yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage \\nyou've been reading and it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here. But in reality, we don't know anything you \\ndon't know. We don't know how reliable the press coverage is. And so, in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital return and buyback \\ntrajectory, not much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comments that I made then, the comments that Jamie \\nmade then, as well as the comments that Jamie made the subsequent week at an industry conference. \\n\\nSo, maybe I'll just briefly summarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is, one, we do recognize that our current practice on \\ncapital return and buybacks does lead to an ever-expanding CET1 ratio. But obviously, we're going to run the company over the cycle over \\ntime at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirement. So, after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of \\nthe deployment of the capital, one way or another, is a matter of when, not if. \\n\\nOn the capital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly. Growing the business \\norganically and inorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the board's announced intention to increase it to \\n$1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year. So, that's a testament to our performance and that is a return of capital.</td>\n","      <td>Dodged</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Okay, got it. That's helpful. Just following up on capital returns on Steve's question, I think you highlighted in response it's a matter of when, \\nnot if, and obviously, Jamie’s not there, you can’t speak for Jamie, but seems to have shown limited enthusiasm for a special dividend or \\nbuybacks at current valuations. Can you just give us a sense of how you’re thinking about the various options? Any updated thoughts on a \\nspecial dividend?

I'm just wondering just where you feel the environment is relative to the \\npotential and just where the dialogue is across the three main bucket areas in terms of, like how does this feel in terms of a current \\nenvironment versus a potential environment that we could still see ahead. Thanks.</td>\n","      <td>Yeah. Thanks, Ken. It's progress, right? I mean, we're happy to see the progress. People have been talking about depressed banking fee \\nwallet for some time and it's nice to see not only the year-on-year pop from a low base, but also a nice sequential improvement. So, that's the \\nfirst thing to say. \\n\\nIn terms of dialog and engagement, it's definitely elevated. So, the dialog on ECM is elevated, and the dialog on M&amp;A is quite robust as well. \\nSo, all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this space. But there \\nare some important caveats. So, on the DCM side, yeah, we made pull-forward comments in the first quarter, but we still feel that this second \\nquarter still reflects a bunch of pull-forward and therefore, we're reasonably cautious about the second half of the year. Importantly, a lot of the \\nactivity is refinancing activity as opposed to, for example, acquisition finance. So, the fact that M&amp;A remains still relatively muted in terms of  \\n\\n7 \\n\\nactual deals has knock-on effects on DCM as well. And when a higher percentage of the wallet is refied, then the pull-forward risk becomes a \\nlittle bit higher. \\n\\nOn ECM, if you look at it kind of at a remove, you might ask the question, given the performance of the overall indices, you would think it \\nwould be a really booming environment for IPOs for example. And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would otherwise expect, \\nand that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that, as has been widely discussed, the extent to which the performance of the large \\nindices is driven by, like a few stocks, the sort of mid-cap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had \\nmuch more muted performance.</td>\n","      <td>Dodged</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>7</th>\n","      <td>you see the same trend happening on the asset-backed finance side because that's a bigger part of the world and it's a bigger part of your \\nbusiness? So, I'd appreciate your thoughts there. Thanks.</td>\n","      <td>Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, on private credit, so nothing really new to say there. I think, I guess, one way the environment's evolving a little bit \\nis, as you know, a lot of money has been raised in private credit funds looking for deals. And sort of a little bit to my prior comment, in a \\nrelatively muted acquisition finance environment, at this point you've got a lot of money chasing, like not that many deals. So, the space is a \\nlittle bit quieter than it was at the margin. \\n\\nAnother interesting thing to note is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated leveraged \\nfinance market making their way into the private market as well as sort of people realize that even in the private market you probably need \\nsome of those protections in some cases, which is sort of supportive of the theme that we've been talking about, about convergence between \\nthe direct lending space and the syndicated lending space, which is kind of our core thesis here, which is that we can offer best-in-class \\nservice across the entire continuum, including secondary market trading and so on. So, we feel optimistic about our offering there. I think the \\ncurrent environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was.

One of the great credit \\nquality stories for everyone, including yourselves, is the C&amp;I portfolio, how strong it's been in this elevated rate environment?

I think we emphasized that at last year's Investor Day, if I remember \\ncorrectly. I think the C&amp;I charge-off rate we've seen in 10 years was something like literally zero. So, that is clearly very low by historical \\nstandards. And while we take a lot of pride in that number and I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of \\nour credit culture across the bankers and the risk team, that's not – we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation. So, you \\nhave to assume there will be some upward pressure on that. But in any given quarter, the C&amp;I numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite \\nidiosyncratic.

I just had one clean-up question, Jeremy. The consensus provision for 2024 is $10.7 billion.

Happy to clarify that. So, Jamie's comments were that the allowance – the build and the Card allowance, so we're talking about Card \\nspecifically, we expected something like $2 billion for the full year. As I sit here today, our expectation for that number is actually slightly  \\nhigher, but it's in the ballpark. And I think in terms of what that means for the consensus on the overall allowance change for the year, last time \\nI checked, it still looked a little low on that front. So, who knows what it'll actually wind up being, but that remains our view. \\n\\nOne question that we've gotten is how to reconcile that build to the 12% growth in OS that we've talked about because it seems like a little bit \\nhigh relative to what you would have otherwise assumed if you apply some sort of a standard coverage ratio to that growth. But the reason  \\n\\n14 \\n\\nthat's the case is essentially a combination of higher revolving mix, as we continue to see some normalization revolve in that 12%, as well as \\nseasoning of earlier vintages, which comes with slightly higher allowance per unit of OS growth. \\n\\n\\nThanks, Erika. \\n...</td>\n","      <td>Dodged</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>25</th>\n","      <td>Right.

I think year-over-year in 2025, consensus has it down 4% from your \\nnew level. So it sounds like consensus still has room to come down, and based on the forward curve, Jeremy, it could be a little bit worse \\nyear-over-year than the fourth quarter sequential rate. But that being said, as Jamie noted, we have no idea what the curve is going to look \\nlike. Right? It's gyrated so much.

You threw a curve ball at the end there, Erika. I wasn't expecting that to be the end of your question. But let me answer the \\nbeginning of your question, and then I'll also answer the end of your question. \\n\\nSo we see the current 2025 consensus for NII ex. Markets to be currently at $87 billion, which is obviously lower than it was at the conference \\nearlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a little toppy, but it's definitely in the \\nballpark. \\n\\nNow that consists of, I already mentioned previously that we sort of expect the NII trough sometime in the middle of the year, so you can kind \\nof assemble the parts. You've got a fourth quarter run rate, you've got some sequential declines, you've got a trough in the middle of the year, \\nand you've got a rough ballpark for the full year. \\n\\nSo you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolve resumes in the \\nback half of the year in both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of Card revolve, although that tailwind will be a little bit less than you \\nmight have otherwise thought. I mean, sorry. A little bit less than it was this year but still a tailwind. \\n\\nCan I just say something. First of all, next time let's just give them the damn number. I don't want to spend all the time on these calls like going \\nthrough what they're guessing what NII is going to be next year. \\n\\nGood. Okay. Now to your question about the EaR. So, a few things to say in there. So, as I already mentioned, when that comes out, it'll show \\na number around $2.1 billion. A very important thing to say is, as you know, the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical EaR \\nis meaningfully higher than our modeled EaR, which is what we disclose. And the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas have, in \\nactuality, been lower than the modeled deposit betas. \\n\\nSo as a starting point, you have to kind of adjust that EaR number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons, \\nactually, there's some nuances around how the dollar, non-dollar sensitivity interact. And then there's your question which is a little bit about \\nthe front-end versus the back-end. \\n\\nSo, what you see is that actually the front-end EaR has gotten smaller and most of the EaR is now in the back-end. So, it's definitely the case \\nthat, all else being equal, a steeper curve is better for us. But I think what I would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical \\nadjustment is disproportionately in the front-end. So therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes, we want a steeper curve, but \\nhaving the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin, for the context of next year's numbers a headwind – \\nwould be a headwind for us, we remain asset sensitive to Fed cuts.  \\n\\n8</td>\n","      <td>Dodged</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>32</th>\n","      <td>And if I can ask my second question, and, Jamie, I completely understand your frustration. And to be fair, your long-term shareholders really \\ndon't care about whether it's $87 billion or $85 billion. Right? They care about your return on equity. To that end, I mean, it's insane how much \\ncapital you generate each quarter, 72 basis points this quarter. \\n\\nAnd so, beyond the standard boilerplate questions you're going to get on buyback and organic growth, yada, yada, dividend increases, how \\nshould we think about JPMorgan deploying this capital? I mean, the world is generally your oyster, right? You're dominant already, and you \\ncould use this capital to further enhance your business. \\n\\nAnd again, beyond that boilerplate conversation that you always get every quarter, how should your shareholders think about how you're \\nthinking about the opportunities to deploy this capital?</td>\n","      <td>Okay. First of all, when you say dominant, I'd be very careful on that. We've got some very tough competition, different in different countries, \\ndifferent around the world, fintech companies, direct lenders and I want to give you a very specific comment on direct lending and stuff like \\nthat. So our goal is always to serve our clients. And when I talk about some of these expenses, that is a deployment of capital, and it's a \\ndeployment in a different way. If you open branches, you initially experience an expense, but down the road you need capital to support the \\ndeposits. Same for the Innovation Economy, same for private bankers, et cetera. If you look at it roughly, we have about a minimum $30 billion \\nof excess capital. And for me, it's not burning a hole in my pocket. I look at it as you own the whole company and you can't properly deploy it \\nnow, it is perfectly reasonable to wait. And I've been quite clear that I think the future could be quite turbulent. And asset prices, in my view, in \\nlife you've got to take a view sometimes, are inflated. I don't know if they're extremely inflated or a little bit, but I prefer to wait. \\n\\nWe will be able to deploy it. Our shareholders will be very well served by us waiting. And same thing with deploying capital. We can go buy \\n$100 billion, 6% mortgages, increase our net income by a couple billion tomorrow. We don't make decisions like that. The most important thing \\nwe do is serve our clients well, build the technology and do things like that. And we also don’t know what the real excess capital is yet. So, \\nwe're a little patient. We're going to be a little patient and wait, and it'll be fine. \\n\\nOne last thing. Cash is a very valuable asset sometimes in a turbulent world. And you see my friend Warren Buffett stockpiling cash right now. \\nI mean, people should be a little more thoughtful about how we're trying to navigate in this world and grow for the long term for our company.  \\n...</td>\n","      <td>Dodged</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>34</th>\n","      <td>Good morning, Jeremy, and good morning, Jamie.

Do you have any insights on how much it may fall from the original proposal to where you are today?</td>\n","      <td>Yeah. When I said we're at $30 billion of excess, that is assuming Barr's speech, that the 20% goes to 12% or whatever it is, more. It'll be \\nmore than that because there are other factors involved. Now, I was just giving the minimum of excess capital. In my view, it would be more, \\nbut it is what it is and we'll wait to see the final numbers. \\n\\n\\nBut, Gerard, just maybe to give you a bit of color. So, yeah. Obviously, everyone paid a lot of attention to that speech. It was an important \\nspeech. But in the end, we actually just really need to see the proposal because the details matter a lot for this stuff. And so our focus is on \\nhoping to see the proposal so that we can process the detail and continue advocating as appropriate. \\nI note that you talk about requirements coming down relative to what was originally proposed which was obviously true per the speech, but I \\ndo think we need to be a little bit careful not to fall into the trap of saying that that's like progress just because the original proposal was so \\ndramatically higher than what anyone thought was reasonable. And I would remind you, which you obviously know, that before this proposal \\ncame out, it was our position strongly felt, that our then-prevailing capital requirements were, if anything, already more than we needed. \\nSo we've got a long way to go here, and I think our position, which Jamie has been articulating very consistently, is that they need to get it \\nright with the right amount of work, and importantly, do it holistically so it's not just RWA. It's RWA, it's G-SIB, it's SCB, it's CCAR. So that's \\nreally what we feel strongly about. \\n\\n\\nWe just want the numbers to be done right and justified.

I mean, it's obviously something we're thinking about a lot. But I could go down some pretty deep rabbit holes speculating on all the \\ndifferent parts of the framework and how they could evolve, and I just don't really think that's productive right now. But let me make some \\nattempt to answer your question. So, backing up a second, if you read Jamie's quotes, they're very consistent with what we've been saying as a \\ncompany for a long time, which is that all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically-assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do  \\ntheir job, supporting the economy, that isn't reflexively anti-bank, that doesn't default to the answer to every question being more of  \\n\\n \\n\\neverything, more capital, more liquidity, that uses data and that balances the obvious goal that we all share of a safe and sound banking system \\nwith actually recognizing that banks play a critical role in supporting growth, and the hope is that we get some of that. \\n\\nCan I just add, no that's great. Jeremy gave it all. Let me add three quick things. Liquidity is also equally important. There's been a lot of \\nrecognition that what counts as liquidity and discount windows and how LCR is done I think is very important. Second is competition. All these \\nthings should be done in light of looking at what kind of public markets you want, what kind of private markets you want, what do you want in \\nthe banking system, what you want out of the banking system. And the third is I think most people realize there is a huge need to take a step \\nback and look at the Byzantine, Balkanized system we built which has negatives, and even the regulators will tell you that. So, at one point, just \\ntake a deep breath. As Jeremy said, let's do the right thing and continue to have the best financial system in the world. \\n</td>\n","      <td>Dodged</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>62</th>\n","      <td>Yes. Hi, good morning. Wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of, Jeremy, the crosscurrents in terms of \\nthe denominator. So, if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put \\nyou in a range of a 5% G-SIB. So, obviously, from what we understand, if you print that – somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then \\nyour G-SIB surcharge goes up by – to 5% or by 50 basis points two years and one day from now. At the same time, around the holidays, we did \\nget the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit from the banks. In terms of the transparency, it looks like the transparency \\nis going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year's stress test. \\n\\nSo, as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7% is clearly a huge number. So, as we think about your \\nreturns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift. So, how should we think about those crosscurrents in terms of two big \\ncomponents, clearly, one is your G-SIB surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer?</td>\n","      <td>Right, Erika. Okay. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. But let's try and address this not too much great length.  \\nFirst of all, G-SIB. So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter. So, while our  \\ncurrent view of G-SIB number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal  \\nseasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures of various \\ntypes. So that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal patterns. So, not much to see there. \\n\\nAnd the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed G-SIB rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up, with the smaller \\nbuckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it's not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other. But, anyway, for \\nnow, we're managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under 5%. Okay, you mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only \\nthing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking \\nabout for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility, and some of the non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR \\nprocess needs improvement. So, that's great. \\n\\nI think I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me, if you just read what they said publicly in their \\npress releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up. So, let's \\njust hope that we see some significant progress on that front. And then, taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is, what \\nis our core view about, and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator, actually. What is our core \\nview about if you just, for the sake of argument, assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator, like actual need \\nfor capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment.</td>\n","      <td>Dodged</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>63</th>\n","      <td>And just a follow-up question – a follow-up to John's line of questioning. As a placeholder, as we think about what you said, trying to arrest the \\ngrowth of CET1, for now, should we just assume that anything that you don't need for organic growth and your dividend obligations in terms of \\nthat 15.7% will be bought back by the company as we think about? I know you don't want to predict the buyback, but is that sort of just a \\nplaceholder for now as we think about what can return back to shareholders in the form of repurchase?</td>\n","      <td>Yeah.

You're like, what else is there to ask? Here's my question. As we think about the \\nNII outlook and you highlighted the NIM pressure, but loan – but basically, balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to – \\ncould you help me understand the order of the drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth \\ninflecting? Is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think \\nabout your comments around you've got the green market share number one, you've got the yellow, you've got the red, places maybe we can't \\nsee. Could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are – where they are? Are they just scattered, everybody – every single \\nbusiness has one? Or are there some that have more than others and, therefore, more opportunities? And is it more balance sheet or fee-\\ngenerative? That's kind of what I'd like to just discuss if you have a minute. Thanks.</td>\n","      <td>Sure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, \\nfrankly, that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance, would be acquisition finance \\nbecause that's been relatively muted as a a function of the M&amp;A environment, and if that picks up you could see more there. Now, those aren't \\nloans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long, so whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever, it's a separate issue. But  \\nas you can see like on our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that Card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a  \\nsignificant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be – it's \\ndecelerating a little bit, rather than the opposite. \\n\\nStill growing above trend obviously, which is great, and it's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're \\ngetting from our Card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well the state of the mortgage market given rates. \\nRates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So, yeah, I think a higher growth \\nenvironment, a little bit more optimism, could you see a bit more loan growth in Business Banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&amp;I at \\nthe margin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So, we'll see. We'll \\nsee what happens there. And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the green, I think you know them, right? And they're aligned with our \\nbig long-standing investment strategies. \\n\\nThank you, Betsy. \\n... \\nOperator: Thank you.

In the meantime, as you well know, we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring all \\nthe new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets.</td>\n","      <td>Dodged</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-2b37a78c-e87e-4dac-8040-0243e3a1ff51')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-2b37a78c-e87e-4dac-8040-0243e3a1ff51 button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

People have been talking about depressed banking fee \\nwallet for some time and it's nice to see not only the year-on-year pop from a low base, but also a nice sequential improvement. So, that's the \\nfirst thing to say. \\n\\nIn terms of dialog and engagement, it's definitely elevated. So, the dialog on ECM is elevated, and the dialog on M&A is quite robust as well. \\nSo, all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this space. But there \\nare some important caveats. So, on the DCM side, yeah, we made pull-forward comments in the first quarter, but we still feel that this second \\nquarter still reflects a bunch of pull-forward and therefore, we're reasonably cautious about the second half of the year. Importantly, a lot of the \\nactivity is refinancing activity as opposed to, for example, acquisition finance. So, the fact that M&A remains still relatively muted in terms of  \\n\\n7 \\n\\nactual deals has knock-on effects on DCM as well. And when a higher percentage of the wallet is refied, then the pull-forward risk becomes a \\nlittle bit higher. \\n\\nOn ECM, if you look at it kind of at a remove, you might ask the question, given the performance of the overall indices, you would think it \\nwould be a really booming environment for IPOs for example. And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would otherwise expect, \\nand that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that, as has been widely discussed, the extent to which the performance of the large \\nindices is driven by, like a few stocks, the sort of mid-cap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had \\nmuch more muted performance. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"evaluation_clean\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Dodged\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":45},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","  --> so far: 01 min :09 s  --> this cell: 00 min :0.038 s"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["qa_analysis_df[qa_analysis_df.evaluation_clean.isin([\"Partially-answered\"])][[\"question\", \"answer\", \"evaluation_clean\"]]"],"metadata":{"id":"UkFWhMxPjYtl","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741533086759,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":45,"user":{"displayName":"Isabel Ornelas","userId":"10375327972682365518"}},"outputId":"40331f4c-8056-4d37-a58f-591b73ae7e5c"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","  <style>\n","    pre {\n","        white-space: pre-wrap;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","  "]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       question  \\\n","2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Hi, good morning.
